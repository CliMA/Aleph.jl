172:
- Updated dependencies

171:
- Changed start date

170:
- Moved precomputed quantities update of SSPKnoth from beginning of each timestep to end of previous timestep

169:
- Moved from Dierckx to Interpolations

168: Updated RRTMGP to v0.15.0
- Updated RRTMGP artifact
- Split solver into longwave and shortwave solvers

167:
- Removed the filter for radiative fluxes when zenith angle is close to 90 degrees

166:
- Move to SSPKnoth

165:
- Removed reference state for the dycore

164:
- Changed approximation for erf in calculation of some boundary conditions for EDMF.

163:
- Fixed bug introduced in 162

162:
- Changed the order of operations in surface conditions calculation.

161:
- Change domain top to 55 km in simulations with high top

160:
- Introduces initial conditions for the baroclinic-wave
  test case in a deep-atmosphere configuration. Modifies
  existing config to use `deep_atmosphere` mode.

159:
- Changed the boundary condition of edmf updraft properties
  to be dependent on the surface area

158:
 - Switched back the precipitation threshold definition in the
   0-moment scheme to specific humidity

157:
 - For the grid mean precipitation tendency in the 0-moment scheme:
    - added limiting by q_tot/dt
    - switched the precipitation threshold definition
      from specific humidity based to supersaturation based

156:
 - Changed start date (changes insolation)
